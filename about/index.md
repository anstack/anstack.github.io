Hi. I'm Carlos Camacho.

A software engineer based in Madrid (Spain) working @ [RedHat](http://www.redhat.com/).

Currently finishing my PhD degree in computer engineering in the [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](http://www.ucm.es/)

I like reading, breaking, fixing and hacking all kind of stuff.

And I usually invest too many hours in front of my laptop.
