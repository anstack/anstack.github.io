We are working preparing some cheatsheets for people jumping into TripleO.

So there is an early WIP version for a few cheatsheets that we want to share:

> TripleO manual installation (Just a copy/paste step-wise process to install TripleO).
>
> Deployments - Debugging tips (Relevant commands to know what's happening with the deployment).
>
> Deployments - CI (URL's and resources to check our CI status).
>
> OOOQ installation (Also a step-wise recipe to install OOOQ, does not exist yet).

We already have some drafts available in [GitHub](https://github.com/ccamacho/tripleo-cheatsheet).

So, we will like to have some feedback from the community and make a
stable version for the cheatsheets in the next week.

Feedback for adding/removing content and general reviews about all of
them is welcomed.

Thanks!!!!
