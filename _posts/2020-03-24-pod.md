COVID-19 is a respiratory illness (which affects breathing)
caused by a new coronavirus.

Symptoms can range from mild, such as a sore throat, to severe,
such as pneumonia. Most people will not need medical attention for
their symptoms. Together we can slow the spread and protect those at higher
risk of severe illness and our health care workers from getting sick.
