Let me present you a Venezuelan Cuatro.
![](/static/cuatro/cuatro.jpg)

This magical device is a string (nylon) musical instrument
tuned (ad'f#'b) typical from Venezuela, similar
to the Ukelele in it's shape, but their character
and playing technique are vastly different.

If you want to learn more about this instrument,
you can download a complete [chords sheet](/static/cuatro/cuatro-chords.pdf)
from The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain or
this [Cuatro method](/static/cuatro/cuatro-method.pdf)

Also you can play these excellent videos from Youtube.
