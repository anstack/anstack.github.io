I had the chance to find a treasure last week, the NES classic mini in
[game.es](https://www.game.es/nintendo-classic-mini-nes-electronica-129248)
for it's official price (Shame on you speculators!!!!).

So.. I just loved this tiny console since I just opened the package.
Lot of people complain about the controller cord being to short
(You have workarounds for this) so for me it's not a problem.

It boots up in less than 5 seconds, shows a nice interface with
all the pre-loaded 30 games ready-to-play in a long list alphabetically
sorted and you will have 4 memory slots for each game.

Playing with this console will be like going back 20 years ago
but so much better, perfect pixels and a really good sound emulation.

Last statement from Nintendo:

> The Nintendo Entertainment System:
> NES Classic Edition system is a hot item,
> and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand.
> There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday
> shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local
> retailers to check product availability. A selection of participating
> retailers can be found at www.Nintendo.com/nes-classic.

You just need to ping retailers pages until you find stock again.

If you can get one, go for it (But don't buy it from speculators)!
