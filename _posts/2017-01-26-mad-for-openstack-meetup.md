Yesterday I had the opportunity of presenting together with Daniel Mellado 
a brief talk about OpenStack and it's integration with services to support
Big Data tools (OpenStack Sahara).

It was a combined talk for two Meetups
[MAD-for-OpenStack](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/MAD-for-OpenStack/events/237131857/)
and
[Data-Science-Madrid](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Data-Science-Madrid/events/236991190/).

The presentation is stored in
[GitHub](https://github.com/ccamacho/openstack-presentations/tree/master/2017-01-25-meetup-openstack101-bigdata).

Regrets:

* We prepared a 1 hour presentation that had to be presented in 20min.
* Wasn't able to have access to our demo server.
